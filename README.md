# Solana Pinocchio Examples

This repository contains a collection of Solana programs built using Pinocchio â€” a new, efficient library for developing Solana programs in Rust with minimal dependencies. Each example demonstrates specific use cases and best practices for building Solana programs with Pinocchio.

## Examples

- [Hello World Program](pinocchio-hello-world/README.md): A simple "hello world" program to demonstrate the basics of using Pinocchio.
- [Counter Program](pinocchio-counter/README.md): A program that allows users to manage an on-chain counter.
- [Vault Program](pinocchio-vault/README.md): A vault program that allows users to securely deposit and withdraw SOL.
- [Escrow Program](pinocchio-escrow/README.md): An escrow program that allows users to securely exchange SPL tokens.


## How to Use

1. Navigate to the individual program directory for detailed instructions.
2. Follow the steps to build, test, and deploy the program.
